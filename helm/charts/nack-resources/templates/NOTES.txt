Thank you for installing the nack-resources chart.

This chart renders NATS JetStream resources (Streams, Consumers, KeyValues, ObjectStores)
managed by the NACK controllers. Ensure the NACK CRDs and controllers are installed.

You can find more information about running NATS JetStream Controller on
